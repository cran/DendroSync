Description: Provides functions for the calculation and plotting of synchrony in 
      tree growth from tree-ring width chronologies (TRW index). It combines
      variance-covariance (VCOV) mixed modelling with functions that quantify 
      the degree to which the TRW chronologies contain a common temporal 
      signal. It also implements temporal trends in spatial synchrony using a 
      moving window. These methods can also be used with other kind of ecological
      variables that have temporal autocorrelation corrected.
